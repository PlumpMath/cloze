# cloze

Experimental library for rewritable data templates. More to come if experiments bear fruit.

## Usage

```clojure
(-> (clozeur '#{a b x}
      '(fn [x]
         (when a b)))
  (bind
    'x 'x
    'a '(number? x)
    'b '(+ 13 x))
  collapse)

;;=>
;; '(fn [x]
;;    (when (number? x)
;;      (+ 13 x)))

```

## Goals and questions

- Implement lambda-calculus-like system with associative interface.
- Explore potential of rewrite systems without pattern matching.

The plan is to provide a fully extensible, context-sensitive replacement protocol for elements that can manipulate and examine their context within a data structure, enabling otherwise difficult or impossible behavior such as splicing to be defined ala carte. This can be achieved by passing the zipper itself (as a reification of the current position within the data structure) to the replacement method of certain elements.

```clojure
(->
  (clozeur '#{a} '[:start a :end])
  (bind 'a (splicing [0 1 2 3]))
  collapse)

;=> [:start 0 1 2 3 :end]
```
